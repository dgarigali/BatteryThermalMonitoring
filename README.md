# LoRa based thermal monitoring system for batteries in energy substations

This project was developed for the Wireless Communication Networks course. It aims to acquire, transmit and store data regarding the temperature variation across battery cells (mainly used for photovoltaic systems) in order to check if temperature is within threshold and uniform across all battery cells.
